                       Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or two in tandem surfing),
                   uses a board to ride on the forward section, or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries 
                        the surfer towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on ocean shores,
                                   but can also be found in standing waves in the open ocean, in lakes, in rivers
                        in the form of a tidal bore, or in wave pools.The term surfing refers to a person riding a wave
                    using a board, regardless of the stance. There are several types of boards.The Moche of Peru would 
               often surf on reed craft, while the native peoples of the Pacific surfed waves on alaia,paipo,and other such 
                  water craft. Ancient cultures often surfed on their belly and knees, while the modern-day definition of 
                             surfing most often refers to a surfer riding a wave standing on a surfboard; this is also  
                                  referred to as stand-up surfing.Another prominent form of surfing is body boarding, 
                      where a surfer rides the wave on a bodyboard, either lying on their belly, drop knee (one foot
                             and one knee on the board), or sometimes even standing up on a body board. Other 
                                                     types of surfing include knee boarding, surf matting 
                          (riding inflatable mats) and using foils. Body surfing, in which the wave is caught and
                                ridden using the surfer's own body rather than a board,is very common and is
                                      considered by some surfers to be the purest form of surfing. The closest
                       form of body surfing using a board is a handboard which normally has one strap over it to fit 
                                                                                       on one hand.</h2></pre><br><br><br><br><br>
